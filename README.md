# Transportation-Simplex

This project aims at providing the optimal solution for minimum transportation costing based on two decision variables along with a pictorial overview of the problem. The project will use Python to build a mathematical model of the problem using business analytics and modeling techniques. In addition to solving the transportation problem, the project will also explore the data and identify trends and patterns using an interactive report prepared using SAS Visual Analytics.
